   **** WARNING ****

   You appear to have loaded the [toolbelt] release on an errand VM.
   This is totally okay, and normally would not cause any problems,
   however the toolbelt* templates have superseded the actual errand
   templates.

   This isn't great.

   You probably wanted to run your _actual_ errands, not the toolbelt
   errand script.  If so, you'll need to move the toolbelt-y parts of
   the errand jobs \`templates:' section to the bottom.

   **** WARNING ****
